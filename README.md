# heap-manager
This project builds a fully functional implicit and explicit heap managers in C using doubly linked list to keep track of free memory blocks on the heap, in-place reallocation, and coalescing of free blocks for increased utilization.

I leveraged C structs and pointers, Linux/Unix, GDB debugging interface, and Valgrind.

Files I wrote from scratch include `explicit.c`, `implicit.c`, `readme.txt`, and `custom_tests`.
