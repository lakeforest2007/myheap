# MyHeap

## Project Overview

This project builds a fully functional implicit and explicit heap managers in C using doubly linked list to keep track of free memory blocks on the heap, in-place reallocation, and coalescing of free blocks for increased utilization. The key tools I leveraged were C structs and pointers, Linux/Unix, GDB debugging interface, and Valgrind.
